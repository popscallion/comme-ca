# ENTRYPOINT (HANDOFF)

> **READ FIRST:** This file contains the critical context, recent changes, and immediate directives for the next agent or developer working on this repository.

## 1. The Situation

**Phase:** Architecture Sync & Debugging.

We are synchronizing `comme-ca` with the **Larval Incubator** patterns (`fahn-lai-bun`, `larval-incubator`) to standardize the "Intelligence Monorepo" structure.

**Critical Issue (Paused):** The `cca audit` "Stdout Capture Deadlock" investigation is currently PAUSED to prioritize this structure sync. The issue details are documented in `specs/headless-claude/_ENTRYPOINT.md` (formerly `HEADLESS-CLAUDE.md`).
