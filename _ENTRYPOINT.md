# ENTRYPOINT (HANDOFF)

> **READ FIRST:** This file contains the critical context, recent changes, and immediate directives for the next agent or developer working on this repository.

## 1. The Situation
**Process Hardening + Research Phase.**
Two active specs: (1) Process hardening to prevent verification blind spots, (2) Research into external agent abstraction patterns (Anthropic Skills, Gemini CLI multi-agent) for potential integration.

## 2. Recent Actions
*   **Naming Conventions:** Enforced strict naming conventions across repo.
*   **Session Reflection:** Analyzed missed `tasks.md` references → created process hardening spec.
*   **Agent Research:** Created new spec to investigate Anthropic Skills and Gemini CLI patterns.

## 3. Immediate Directives (Mission)
1.  **PRIORITY 1:** Implement `specs/feature-process-hardening/` — Add Search Hygiene and Verification rules.
2.  **PRIORITY 2:** Research `specs/feature-agent-abstraction-research/` — Codebase discovery + clarification pass.
3.  **Maintain Hygiene:** Follow strict naming conventions.
