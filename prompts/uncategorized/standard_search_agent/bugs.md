This is a conceptual clarification question that I can answer well from training data without needing to search. I should create clear, relatable analogies to distinguish these three approaches.\n\nLet me think about good analogies:\n- Direct API: Like directly calling contractors yourself\n- Regular MCP: Like using a staffing agency that handles multiple contractors\n- Code execution + MCP: Like having a smart assistant who can figure out which contractors to call and coordinate the work without bothering you every step\n\nActually, a better one might be restaurant/kitchen related or translator-based. Let me go with a \"ordering from restaurants\" analogy as it's intuitive.\n",
