# Governance: The Do-ocracy

This project operates on a "Do-ocracy" model: **decisions are made by those who do the work.**

## 1. Core Philosophy
*   **Permissionless Contribution:** You do not need permission to fix a bug, improve documentation, or propose a feature.
*   **Earned Authority:** Merge rights are not status symbols; they are tools given to those who demonstrate competence and alignment with the project's goals.
*   **Bias for Action:** We prefer "rough consensus and running code" over endless debate.

## 2. Contribution Tiers

### Contributor
Anyone who submits a Pull Request (PR) or an Issue.
*   **Rights:** Fork, Clone, PR, Issue.
*   **Responsibilities:** Follow the Code of Conduct, respect the project's scope.

### Maintainer
A contributor who has merged **1 significant PR** or **3 minor PRs**.
*   **Rights:** Merge PRs, Close Issues, Manage Releases.
*   **Responsibilities:** Review incoming PRs, maintain code quality, mentor new contributors.
*   **Access:** Granted via GitHub "Write" access.

## 3. Decision Making
*   **Consensus:** For major changes, we seek consensus among Maintainers.
*   **Lazy Consensus:** If no objections are raised within 72 hours, the proposal is accepted.
*   **Tie-Breaker:** In the event of a deadlock, the Project Owner (repository creator) has the final say.

## 4. Commercial & Legal
*   **License:** This project is licensed under the **{{LICENSE_TYPE}}**. All contributions are effectively dual-licensed:
    1.  Publicly under the {{LICENSE_TYPE}}.
    2.  Privately to the Project Owner (to allow for potential future relicensing or enforcement).
*   **Monetization:** The Project Owner reserves the right to monetize the project via sponsorships, hosted versions, or dual-licensing arrangements (e.g., selling exceptions to the AGPL).

## 5. Code of Conduct
We adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). Be kind, be professional, and assume positive intent.
