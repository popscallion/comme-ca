# OPENCODE

> **Pointer Document:** This file tells OpenCode agents to look at `AGENTS.md` for project context and roles.

## Context Loading
All agent instructions, subagent definitions, and project-specific rules are defined in [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md).

## Usage
When starting an OpenCode session, ensure the agent reads the `AGENTS.md` file first to understand the "Discovery First" and "Standardized Epistemology" policies of this repository.

## Commands
OpenCode supports Model Context Protocol (MCP). Use the `serena` MCP server for surgical code editing and memory persistence.
