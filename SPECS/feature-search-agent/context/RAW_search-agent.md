maybe a bin/search (not haiku) script in coome-ca is the right approach? since we'd want this avaialble wherever comme-ca is installed but it overlaps with but isnt strictly part of cca's scaffolding? unelss it is in the sense that it makes a tool availble that comme ca agents will need, and it would benefit from the strict prompt syncing planned for comme ca's utility prompts as well? make a cse either way for bin/search vs incorporate search function into bin/cca to discuss iwth me. i want htis to have two behaviors: avaialble as a search tool abstraction layer to an agent in e.g. the middle of a clarify operation to get fresh info, or more generally avaialble for gemini-cli or claude code to discover as a tool in a project thats been scaffolded with comme-ca, and alloinwg agents to spawn subprocesses with queries intended to specifically flesh out specs further while encapsulating the tools and specific search prompt guidelines needed to avoid context pollution, and mode b is ability to be directly invoked from shell so the user can get queries quickly answered and logged to the terminal scrollback and optionally copy paste into a spec file in zed or echo into one, the key is i'd like familiar low cognitive load oergonomics; the haiku45 prompt was originally developed as a system prompt to use as a raycast chat preset, so the flow i'm used to is hotkey to invoke raycast cahat with the haiku research prompt loaded in, and then immediately ask a question nad get response in chat, and then be able to continue the conversation in chat.if you look at my fish config that i put in @temp_fishconfig.md youll see i have an abbreviation set up for llm cli tool that behaves in a related way where i can spawn a query with ? and then continue it with comma which seems analogous to calling claude code headless iwth auto-assigned session id made up by agen --session-id for initial query and then any followups with --resume flag and then the sam id, so full invocation would be probably something like [query from agent ] | claude -p --system-prompt-file (point to synced search prompt like the haiku45 one)  --allowed-tools "e.g. exa, tavily, perplexity, sequential thining" --mcp-config [json file set up by cca? to make this portable and not rely on the right mcps necessarily being installed for claude code systemwide, can inherit searhc api keys from env] --dangrously-skip-permissions [to deal with mcp call permissions] --model haiku (for speed and searhc agent doesnt need to be he smartes) --strict-mcp-config (to override any globally definedones) (and optionally pass through verbose so invoking user or agent has visibiltiy into what search agnet is thinking and can steer) and this seems clunkier than just defining subagent ad hoc on the fly with e.g. claude -p --agents (json subagent def) but im not sure if that route permits linking to fiels for better sync of search prompt? and i think this i cleaner and more predictable and maintainable than giving e.g. gemini cli direct access to the search mcps and preservers ergonomics and doesnt fill up gemini cli's context window with serach content besides result of the query, but im open to hearing an argument for the opposite? anyway this is all part of my requirement here, think about all of this and discuss. also it's possible that it's not feasible to re-use the haiku-45 prompt for this overall and we should adapt the logic since there's semantic routing in there that is built for interactive use where the model gives immediate top of head answer and then backs it up with serach tools if user requests it which seems pointless when being called by an agnet like gemini cli that's smarter and knows what query to construct? consider all the possibilities and create a comprehsnsive discussion document in project root iwth everything you think of, we will discuss it in the next turn, once you make that doc you can append to entrypoint iwthout replacing existing next steps and in the next session we'll go back to the discussion doc and we can clarify
