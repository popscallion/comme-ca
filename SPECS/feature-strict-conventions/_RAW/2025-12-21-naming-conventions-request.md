# Naming Conventions and Structure Refactor Request

(Captured from User Prompt)

I want to enforce some naming conventions here. We should reserve underscore to flag special files or folder that are unique in some way. There can be only one of each an underscore file and underscore folder per level of the directory hierarchy. We should use all caps, flag, meta, documents, like agents or readme or or license entry point, we should make sure that design and requirements are also all caps. I also want to try and reduce the nesting by incorporating some information in file and folder names and making sure that agents know to follow this convention. So for instance, within the specs folder, I want files and folders to have names that begin with either bug or feature. SPECS/context/bug-wrap-recursion-fail.md should be moved to the specs root as it is a self contained minimal bug-type spec. SPECS/flow-audit/flow-audit.md should be SPECS/feature-flow-audit.md. SPECS/headless-claude can remain a folder since it contains multiple things, but shoudl be renamed to SPECS/feature-headless-claude and the context folder should be capitalized and underscored to *RAW which should be documented somewhere as another special file type like ENTRYPOINT.md and ARCHIVE, and the contents of _RAW and ARCHIVE should have date stamps in YYYY-MM-DD format in title whenever possible (no need to mock or infer for existing files, just moving forward). any spec may contain a* _RAW folder which serves to house (datestamped in title) llm conversations or bug reports or screenshots or sketches that have yet to be refined into proper spec artifacts (This may also occur when a spec is proposed and then completed in a single turn. So there's no need for refinement. So keep that in mind, that that may also occur.

_ARCHIVE only exists in specs to serve as historical record so we don’t reinvent the wheel, and should be considered short- to medium- term storage (long term archive contents will be removed and we rely on git history Once we're definitively outside the window relevance and don't need to easily revisit past features or bugs).
we need to discontinue the use of [task.md](https://task.md) and look for any mention of it anywhere in the codebase especially within the roles and other prompts and scaffoldin,g and make sure everyone knows that entrypoint is meant to serve as short term task scratchpad while someting is active, and upcoming tasks are just represented by specs. we’ll want to run a pass thoruhg the codebase renaming every existing [task.md](https://task.md) so there’s no confusion. PRD and ADR should always be all caps, and checks and features evolve, they eventually get refined into REQUIREMENTS and DESIGN respectively. _INBOX is the only underscore all caps folder allowed in the project root and is special: the appropriate role or maybe htis goes in the project scaffolded [AGENTS.md](https://AGENTS.md) (discuss where is more appropriate) should have explicit instructions to keep an eye on the contents and either automatically move and organize in specs under new bugs or features, or prompt to user to ask what to do with them. The purpose of inbox is to serve as an easy quick add intake for new bugs or features or just thoughts the user had. These will be pretty loosely organized. The user may or may not have had the time to hint to the system what these should be by giving them bug or feature in the name.

So the system should be flexible enough to be able to automatically triage them. Likely contents are either pasted transcripts in markdown files from LLM conversations or markdown files of loose specs or feature requirements dictated by the user and or screenshots or photos that may or may not be organized in a subdirectory or be named to hint at where they are or what they pertain to that capture some sort of either sketch of a desired feature or a screenshot of a observed bug. part of the role of either taste or pass or maybe just general agent behavior is to make sure inbox is always clear at the end of a session And everything within it has moved to the appropriate home usually _*RAW folder in a spec subdirectory (note that this practice supersedes sources/raw-chats and so that should be removed*). Agents should always ask users to clarify what something is or where it should go in case of ambiguity. They should be low initiative in deciding on their own in this case.

remember that comme-ca is recursive and needs to practice what it preaches, so the first step for you here is to act as though The requested changes have already been implemented, which would mean that what I'm saying to you here should be captured as marked down and placed inside the _RAW folder of a new spec that begins with the string “feature-”.
