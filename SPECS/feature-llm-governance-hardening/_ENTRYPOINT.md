# LLM Governance Hardening Dashboard

**Phase:** 0 (Inception)
**Status:** Planning behavioral shift.

## Current SITREP
We have identified three critical LLM failure modes during a documentation audit. We are pivoting from a "fix the casing" approach to a "fix the agent behavior" approach.

## Next Actions
1.  [ ] Define formal "Epistemic Hierarchy" between Governor and Distro.
2.  [ ] Research "Phase-Gate" prompting architectures.
3.  [ ] Establish "Zero-Entropy" as a non-negotiable protocol constraint.
