# Requirements: Behavioral Hardening

## Functional Requirements
- **Sequentiality:** Protocols must enforce temporal separation of Syntactic vs Semantic passes.
- **Authority:** Agents must automatically resolve local/upstream conflicts in favor of the Governor.
- **Completeness:** Modifications must trigger neighbor audits to prevent mixed-state entropy.

## Constraints
- **Zero Symptom-Fixing:** No directives that merely list "things to check." All changes must address the *way* the agent thinks/works.
