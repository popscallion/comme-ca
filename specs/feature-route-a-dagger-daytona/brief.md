Help me research and think through an architectural decision. I am working on multiple projects in parallel with the assistance of LLM tools. Usually the flow is I will ask a question that kicks off a research round by the agent and then we'll go back and forth a few turns and then I will ask the agent to produce a ADR and PRD, which I will then place as markdown files in a subdirectory of a specs folder in either an existing or new git repository.

So that's the initial discovery and framing phase and then to further pursue these projects in parallel what I usually need is at least one LLM instance a terminal or better an IDE I usually use Z to inspect code changes and read files and approve tool calls. Usually I I'll ask my agents to save their findings or any new outputs to markdown files in my repos.

And I'll usually want a browser window open as well. This is to inspect progress on the projects if they are front-end ones in a running dev server and or to follow up on or fact check findings from my agents on the internet when they supply sources or things to look up.

Currently I'm having trouble sandboxing these projects and I end up with a mixture of tabs and windows that are very difficult to keep track of even when using separate spaces on the same machine. I think what would maybe be a better pattern is if I was somehow able to sandbox my projects on a headless remote machine and then access them over SSH within the same tailnet.

That way I could have multiple instances of Zed pointed at different remote folders on my headless dev machine. I could have agents working in those in parallel. And those agents would have access to headless browsers for advanced browser in the loop development workflows and then I would be able to access any running dev servers over Tailnet for visual inspection if needed.

And then I could just have one other browser window open for fact checking, etcetera. It seems to me that there might be a low lift and a high lift, high reward version of this pattern, where the low lift version is essentially what I just described, where I maintain my repos on a single remote and have multiple agents working in separate sessions on the remote in parallel.

What this doesn't solve is the sort of management problem where it's still on me to keep track of what's happened in which project and when and to resolve any Git conflicts. I quite like the UX of something like Claude Code on in the cloud or Terragon Labs where the flow seems to be you have a project and for each new thread with the agent, the agent spins up a isolated sandbox environment with a branch of the project works on that feature and then notifies the user for review when they're at a good sto.pping point This seems like it might take a little work to set up, but would probably pay off very well in terms of convenience and decreased cognitive load for me having to manage these parallel projects.

One concern I have is this might start to tax my headless dev machine after a while, especially if the agents are making a lot of tool calls simultaneously, even if they're isolated from one another. Which then leads me to wonder if I could replicate the cloud code on the web experience by doing something like Podman or some other sort of containerized treatment on a VPS or some provider like digital ocean or railway, spinning up little isolated sandboxed images or instances whenever I want to kick off a new development effort and then those might be easier to manage and leave running.

Does this make sense? Think about what I've described to you and give me your impressions and then I'd like you to look into whether there's existing tool chains that support this or how much of this I can do off the shelf and how much I would have to build.

Remember that i have hybrid needs, where some projects/tasks are high autonomy/low touch and can be pursued with no babysitting even if the agnet occasionally needs access to a browser for e.g. automated visual testing or console based autonomus debugging; other tasks/projects are high-touch+medium-autonomy and benefit from me being able to follow along either via moonlight/vnc/rdp stream or by watching the dev server from a local browser and looking at changes and giving feedback (e.g. iterative front-end/design-heavy proejcts or things where the agent may be required to  freuqently pasuse and ask user for clarification and or preferences.
