# ⚠️ SUPERSEDED ⚠️

**Notice:** This audit prompt has been superseded by the **Agentic Abstractions** implementation in `comme-ca` and the **Zellij + OpenCode + YubiKey** migration plan in `comme-ci`.

**Reason:** Serena is now managed as a **Skill** within `comme-ca` and an **MCP Server** within `comme-ci`. Steering is centralized in `prompts/skills/serena.md`.
